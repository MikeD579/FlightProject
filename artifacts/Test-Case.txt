GIVEN:
---------------------------------------
BANK ANGLE: 30 DEGREES
VELOCITY: 65 KNOTS
GLIDE RATIO: 9:1
GLIDE RATIO AT 30 DEGREES: 7.79:1
ASSUMPTION: Hold the bank angle for 2 seconds
ASSUMPTION: Plane starting facing is 90 degrees
STARTING COORDINATES: (0,0)
STARTING HEIGHT: 350 feet

// Note that 1091 is a constant 
// Formulas taken from https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2871/how-to-calculate-angular-velocity-and-radius-of-a-turn
TURN RATE: 1,091tan(30)/65 = 9.69 deg/s
// Degrees traveled is the turn rate times the time bank angle is held.
DEGREES TRAVELED: 9.69 * 2 = 19.38 deg (theta for arc)

// Formula taken from https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/2871/how-to-calculate-angular-velocity-and-radius-of-a-turn
// Arc length is circumference times (angle / 360)
RADIUS OF TURN: 65^2/(11.26 * tan(30)) = 604.904 feet
ARC LENGTH: 2 * pi * 604.904 * 19.38 / 360 = 204.50 feet
NEW FACING IN DEGREES: 90 + 19.38 = 109.38

// We derived this formula. The PNG from the paint session is in github.
HEIGHT LOST DURING THE TURN: 2 * 65 knots(1.6878099) / (7.79) = 28.17 feet

// Using trig and the radius, we deduced how to do this.
// 19.38 is the degrees of the outter arc, but is the same for the triangle we drew.
// Subtracted the product from the radius to figure out how far in x direction traveled.
X COORD: 604.904 * cos(19.38) = 570.63
         604.904 - 570.63 = 33.974
Y COORD: 604.904 * sin(19.38) = 200.73
COORDINATES FOR ENDING BANK: (-33.974, 200.73) with a facing of 109.38 degrees



FINAL LANDING:
convert from rect -> polar
sqrt((-33.974)^2 + (200.73)^2) = 203.59 at angle 109.38

add the vector of the glide distance
NEW HEIGHT = 350 - 28.17 = 321.83 feet
VECTOR FOR GLIDE DISTANCE: 321.83 * 9 = 2896.47

FINAL MAGNITUDE = 3218.3

convert back to rect
X: 2896.47 * cos(109.38) = -961.141
Y: 2896.47 * sin(109.38) = 2732.35

FINAL COORDS: (-961.141, 2732.35) in feet

** ARC LENGTH IS CIRCUMFERENCE * (ARC THETA / 360)
** 1.6878099 feet/s = 1 knot
